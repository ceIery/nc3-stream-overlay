# [Nashe Cup 3](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1965851?n=1) Stream Overlay

This overlay is intended to be used with [tosu version 3.3.0](https://github.com/KotRikD/tosu/releases/tag/v3.3.0). Compatibility not guaranteed with other versions.

Assets and design created by [megumic](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7537133). Original overlay created by [shdewz](https://github.com/shdewz) and [ILW8](https://github.com/ILW8) for [4 Digit World Cup 2024](https://github.com/shdewz/4wc-stream-overlay).

## Notes

- Each osu! client should have a resolution of 600x300 in OBS. You can set `Height = 900` in `tournament.cfg` to accomplish this without scaling in OBS, but the buttons on the tournament manager may not be aligned correctly if your monitor resolution is 1080p or lower.
- Only the `main` and `gameplay` overlays are in use.
